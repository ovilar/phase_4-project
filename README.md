# Time Series Project: Predicting House Prices
In this project, I work with a dataset from Zillow that has house prices over the course of several 
month-years, starting in 1996. The dataset also provides other information such as: zip code, region, 
county name and city - to name a few. I analyze these series using a time series approach and provide 
recommendations for an hypothetical real estate firm.

The modeling framework is streamlined as follows: time series analysis, basic and rolling statistics, 
seasonal decomposition, unit-root test, SARIMAX modeling and prediction. Lastly, we delve deeper into the 
data, repeating this process with microscopic lenses.

## Business Problem
An hypothetical is looking to diversify its portfolio. Thinking of risk-weighted returns, then the firm 
seeks advisory for spotting the best areas over the course of 12-24 months. The stakeholders of this 
problem, besides the investment firm, are: general public and outside investors, 
municipalities and counties and communities in general.

## Data and Analysis
The dataset used is a time series from Zillow, that has house prices over the course of Apr/96 through 
Apr/18. Besides prices, there are the other categorical variables: RegionID, RegionName, City, State, 
Metro, CountyName and SizeRank.

Splitting and ranking the dataset into the top 10 counties with respect to median prices, we end up with 
the following locations:

### Recommendation

### Further Research
I list below some ideas about further research:
<ul>
<li>Implementing Portfolio Theory as a way of assessing optimizing investment strategies;</li>
<li>Adding exogenous features that might explain house prices (such as socio-economic data, school 
district data, etc.);</li>
<li>Delving deeper to explain the variation within counties to assess under/overpriced real state.</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
This repository provides basic guidelines on how to navigate through this notebook and its material. For 
the sake of space, I do not make the dataset available.
